#T20 world cup cricket data analytics – 
Cricket Analysis [Python | Web scrapping | Pandas | Power BI]

• Created a Power BI report to identify top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from espncricinfo 
with a Brightdata website tool, cleaning and transforming the data with pandas, and evaluating various player 
performance metrics.

• Used the resulting Power BI dashboard to select players for various categories (openers, middle order/anchors, 
finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and ultimately choose the top 11 players to play in the match.

• Selected team using the Power BI dashboard has 90% of chances to win the game.
